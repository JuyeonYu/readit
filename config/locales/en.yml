        title: "Frequently Asked Questions"
        subtitle: "Everything you need to know before getting started."
        q1:
          question: "How does MessageOpen work?"
          answer: "Write your message in our editor, and we generate a unique link. Share that link anywhere — email, Slack, WhatsApp, SMS, or any platform. When your recipient clicks the link and reads your message, you get an instant notification."
        q2:
          question: "Does the recipient need to install anything or create an account?"
          answer: "No. Recipients simply click the link and read your message in their browser. No app download, no signup, no extra steps. It works just like opening any web page."
        q3:
          question: "Can the recipient tell that I'll be notified when they read it?"
          answer: "The recipient sees a clean, professional message page — similar to a shared Google Doc or Notion page. There are no intrusive banners or alerts. It's designed to feel natural and respectful."
        q4:
          question: "Is my message content secure?"
          answer: "Yes. All messages are encrypted in transit. You can also add password protection so only the intended recipient can view your message, and set expiration dates to auto-delete messages after a specific time."
        q5:
          question: "What's included in the free plan?"
          answer: "The free plan includes 10 messages per month with basic read notifications and 7-day message history. No credit card required, and it's free forever — not a trial."
        q6:
          question: "Can I use MessageOpen with my existing tools?"
          answer: "Absolutely. MessageOpen works alongside any tool you already use. Just paste your message link into email, Slack, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, SMS, or any platform that supports links. No integrations to set up."
